<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choroidal Neovascularization Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intravitreal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Choroidal neovascularization market consists of two main types - intravenous and intravitreal treatments. Intravenous therapy involves administering medications directly into the bloodstream through a vein, targeting the underlying cause of the condition. In contrast, intravitreal injections deliver medication directly into the vitreous gel of the eye, achieving a more localized treatment approach. Both methods aim to reduce abnormal blood vessel growth in the choroid, improving vision and preventing further damage in patients with choroidal neovascularization.</p></p>
