<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Infusion Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-Loop</li><li>Open-Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Insulin infusion pumps can be categorized into two types: closed-loop and open-loop systems. Closed-loop systems, also known as automated insulin delivery systems, continuously monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin delivery accordingly. This type of system provides more precise control over glucose levels and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, open-loop systems require manual input of insulin doses by the user based on factors like diet, exercise, and blood glucose levels. Both types of systems have their own advantages and limitations, catering to the varying needs of individuals with diabetes.</p></p>
