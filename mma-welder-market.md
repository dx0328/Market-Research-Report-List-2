<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MMA Welder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Power</li><li>DC Power</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC power and DC power are two different types of markets within the MMA (Manual Metal Arc) welder industry. AC power welders use alternating current to create an electric arc for welding, while DC power welders use direct current. AC power welders are commonly used for welding thinner materials and are more cost-effective, while DC power welders are preferred for welding thicker materials due to their higher efficiency and stronger welds. Both types of welders have their own advantages and are suited for different applications within the welding industry.</p></p>
