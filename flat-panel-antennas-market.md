<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel Antennas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronically-steered Antenna</li><li>Mechanically-steered Antenna</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat panel antennas are available in two main types: electronically-steered antennas and mechanically-steered antennas. Electronically-steered antennas use phased array technology to electronically adjust the direction of the antenna beam without any moving parts. This allows for faster and more precise adjustments to optimize signal reception. On the other hand, mechanically-steered antennas use moving parts to physically adjust the direction of the antenna beam. While mechanically-steered antennas may have lower upfront costs, they may be slower to adjust and require more maintenance in the long run.</p></p>
