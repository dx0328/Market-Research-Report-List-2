<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welding Helmet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Welding Helmet</li><li>Auto Darkening Welding Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Passive Welding Helmets are traditional helmets with a fixed dark lens that requires the welder to manually lift the helmet to see outside of welding. Auto Darkening Welding Helmets use advanced technology to automatically adjust the lens darkness according to the brightness of the welding arc, allowing the welder to maintain visibility without constantly flipping the helmet. The market for Auto Darkening Welding Helmets is growing due to their convenience and improved safety features compared to Passive Welding Helmets.</p></p>
